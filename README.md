This repository covers a famous online course on Udemy mentioned above. I learned different peripherals with code exercices related with PWM, CAN, and Low-power Mode MCUs.
## Phase-locked loop
A phase-locked loop or phase lock loop (PLL) is a control system that generates an output signal whose phase is related to the phase of an input signal. 
There are several different types; the simplest is an electronic circuit consisting of a variable frequency oscillator and a phase detector in a feedback loop. 
The oscillator generates a periodic signal, and the phase detector compares the phase of that signal with the phase of the input periodic signal, 
adjusting the oscillator to keep the phases matched. (Source:Wikipedia)
